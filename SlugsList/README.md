Slugslist
===================================

A Web2py-powered application to semi-anonymously pair students together to match their academic needs. If one student needs a tutor in a class, and another student is able to tutor that class, Slugslist will match them together and allow them to communicate through the app. Slugslist also features a class review page, in which students can anonymously review a class for other students to investigate before enrolling.
